Enjoy the restaurants demo application.  This is meant to show how to add
some of advanced features of the Facebook Platform to your current application.
Create an API key, point it to this code, and start playing.

---------------------------------------
CODE ORGANIZATION:

demo_libs/facebook-platform/
  The usual PHP5 client downloaded from developers.facebook.com/resources.php.

demo_libs/ 
  Libraries for display and data access

images/
  Some star images for the AJAX component.

migrate/
  Tools to give you some data for your MySQL database to get started, and to
  move this data over in under a minute to the Facebook Data API.

index.php
  The entrypoint for most of the application.

ajax_rate.php
  If AJAX turned on, this is the endpoint that the AJAX call hits on the
  backend to add user ratings.

---------------------------------------
SETUP

1. Put this code under your web root.   

2. Go to your mysql instance and add a database called 'restaurant_demo'
3. Insert sample restaurant profile info into this database with this command:
  mysql restaurant_demo < migrate/mysqldump_advanced_demo

  This will also create a table called restaurant_user where your (and your friends')
  ratings will go.  No user restaurant ratings are provided in the mysql dump.
4. Set up the API key and secret key using the Developers app on Facebook.
  http://www.facebook.com/developers/apps.php.
5. Change demo_libs/config.php to reflect your APP_ROOT_URL
   (e.g. http://apps.facebook.com/my_restaurant_app) 
5. Change demo_libs/config.php to reflect your CODE_ROOT_URL
   (e.g. http://my.server/path_to_this_package) 

   Note that ajax_rate.php should be under this.
6. Add the appropriate IP, user name, password, and database name to the
  mysql connect statements at the bottom of demo_libs/config.php.

Start by hitting http://apps.facebook.com/my_restaurant_app/index.php.
You should see restaurants, but no ratings.  You and your friends can start adding ratings.

---------------------------------------
MIGRATING DATA FROM MYSQL TO THE FB DATA STORE API

1. Run http://apps.facebook.com/my_restaurant_app/migrate/define_data.php

  This sets up object and association types for your view of the data store API.

2. Run http://apps.facebook.com/my_restaurant_app/migrate/migrate_data.php
  This migrates the data from your mysql instance to your view of the data store API.
  This should be done while logged in as the Facebook user who created the app, or as a 
  developer of the app.  This can take a while, so the page may time out, but your PHP error logs
  should receive messages showing you that the migration is taking place.
3. Note that you should change permissions on library and migration code to be 
  unviewable from the web after this is done.
---------------------------------------

TWEAKING APPLICATION FUNCTIONALITY 

When playing with the application, use the flags in demo_libs/config.php.  
Turning these on (any nonzero value) shows the addition of some advanced 
features.  Specifically:

* Setting $USE_JS adds a typeahead capability based on FBJS, allowing the
  user to "search" for a restaurant instead of just click.

* Setting $USE_AJAX adds a Mock Ajax-based rating capability, keeping the user 
  on the restaurant page after rating, to easily check out what restaurants
  friends are going to.

* Setting $USE_DATA_API will switch from using a mysql-backed store to our
  new Facebook-hosted data store.  Details of this API are at
  http://wiki.developers.facebook.com/index.php/Data_Store_API_documentation
  Remember, adding new restaurants/ratings while this is set will only make
  changes to your FB Data Store stuff.  Likewise for mysql when unset.  

---------------------------------

This is just a small sampling of features available on the Facebook Platform.
Enjoy!
