# old-school-fbapps

I developed these facebook apps in the beginning of their apps era, around the year 2007-08. That time facebook just launched this wild idea of implementing and integrating apps into social network from 3rd party developers. These apps were mostly developed as proof of concept related to my work that time. Currently they are of no use. I created this repo just to feed my nostalgia. Good ol' time, huh?!
